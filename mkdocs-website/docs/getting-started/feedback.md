# Feedback

We welcome (and encourage) your feedback! Here are the different ways to provide feedback:

=== "Bugs"

    If you find a bug, please let us know by posting into the [v3 Alpha Feedback](https://discord.gg/3mgVyGua) channel on Discord:
    
    - The post should clearly state what the bug is and have a simple reproducible example. If the docs are unclear what *should* happen, please include that in the post.
    - The post should be given the `Bug` tag.
    - Please include the output of `wails doctor` in your post.
    - *Remember* unexpected behaviour isn't necessarily a bug - it might just not do what you expect it to do. Use [Suggestions](#suggestions) for this.

=== "Fixes"

    If you have a fix for a bug or an update for documentation, please do the following:
    
    - Open a pull request on the [Wails repository](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails). The title of the PR should start with `[v3]`.
    - Create a post in the [v3 Alpha Feedback](https://discord.gg/3mgVyGua) channel.
    - The post should be given the `PR` tag.
    - Please include a link to the PR in your post.

    - The post should be given the `Suggestion` tag.

    Please feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3mgVyGua) if you have any questions.

=== "Upvoting"

    - Posts can be "upvoted" by using the :thumbsup: emoji. Please apply to any posts that are a priority for you. 
    - Please *don't* just add comments like "+1" or "me too". 
    - Please feel free to comment if there is more to add to the post, such as "this bug also affect ARM builds" or "Another option would be to ....."
