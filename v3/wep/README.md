# Wails Enhancement Proposal (WEP) Process

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wails Enhancement Proposal (WEP) process. This guide outlines the steps for proposing, discussing, and implementing feature enhancements in Wails. The process is divided into two main parts:

1. **Submission of Proposal**: This part involves documenting your idea, submitting it for review, and discussing it with the community to gather feedback and refine the proposal.
2. **Implementation of Proposal**: Once a proposal is accepted, the implementation phase begins. This involves developing the feature, submitting a PR for the implementation, and iterating based on feedback until the feature is merged and documented.

Following this structured approach ensures transparency, community involvement, and efficient enhancement of the Wails project.

## Submission of Proposal

### 1. Idea Initiation

- **Document Your Idea**: Clearly document your feature idea using the provided template.

### 2. Submit Proposal

- **Open a PR**:
  - Copy the WEP template located in `v3/wep/WEP_TEMPLATE.md`.
  - Fill in the details (do not remove any sections).
  - Submit a Pull Request (PR) with the title `[WEP] <title>`.

### 3. Community Discussion

- **Share Your Proposal**: Present your proposal to the Wails community. Try to get support for the proposal to increase the chances of acceptance.
- **Gather Feedback**: Refine your proposal based on community input. All feedback should be added as comments in the PR.
- **Show Support**: Agreement with the proposal should be indicated by adding a thumbs-up emoji to the PR. The more thumbs-up emojis, the more likely the proposal will be accepted.

### 4. Assign Implementation

- **Agree on an Implementor**: To avoid stagnant proposals, we require someone agree to implement it. This could be the proposer.

### 5. Final Decision

- **Decision**: The Wails maintainers will make a final decision on the proposal based on community feedback and the proposal's merits. If accepted, the proposal will be assigned a WEP number and the PR merged.

*NOTE*: If a proposal has not met the required support or has been inactive for more than 2 months, it may be closed.

## Implementation of Proposal

Once a proposal has been accepted and an implementation plan has been decided, the focus shifts to bringing the feature to life. This phase encompasses the actual development, review, and integration of the new feature. Here are the steps involved in the implementation process:

### 1. Develop the Feature

- **Follow Standards**: Implement the feature following Wails coding standards.
- **Document the Feature**: Ensure the feature is well-documented during the development process.
- **Submit a PR**: Once implemented, submit a PR for the feature.

### 2. Feedback and Iteration

- **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback from the community.
- **Iterate**: Make improvements based on feedback.

### 3. Merging

- **Review of PR**: Address any review comments.
- **Merge**: The PR will be merged after satisfactory review.
The WEP process ensures structured and collaborative enhancement of Wails. Adhere to this guide to contribute effectively to the project's growth.
